# Northern Pike Client UI

This project uses [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.0.0. If you are using an earlier version of Angular please run `ng update`.

## Development setup

1. Install [Node.js and NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

2. Install project dependencies listed in `package.json` by running `npm install`.

## Development server

At this point developing the Client UI using the `aiohttp` based server is recommended. Use `ng build --watch` to compile the project and watch for changes. The Python server serves the files generated in `northernpike\ui\dist`.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
